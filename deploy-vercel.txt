Vercel (Recommended)
1. First, export your app:
   >> npx expo export

  (This will generate the dist/ folder with your static web app.)

2. Push your project to GitHub.

3. Go to https://vercel.com/ and log in.

4. Import your GitHub project.

5. Vercel auto-detects the React app.

    If needed, set:
    - Framework: Other
    - Build Command: npx expo export
    - Output Directory: dist
